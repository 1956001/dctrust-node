How to become validator in testnet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Install and run Minter Full Node.
    See :ref:`install-minter`. Make sure your node successfully synchronized.

2. Generate and install validator's key using our `tool <https://github.com/MinterTeam/minter-gen-validator>`__.
    If you already have ``priv_validator.json`` file â€“ just replace it with new one.

3. Restart Minter Node and Tendermint.
    Restarting will apply changes to ``priv_validator.json`` file.

4. Go to `Vault <http://vault.minter.network/>`__ and send 2 transactions:
    Fill and send ``Declare candidacy`` and ``Set candidate online`` forms.

    P.S. You can receive testnet coins in our telegram wallet @BipWallet_Bot.

    1. Declare candidacy
        - Address - You will receive rewards to this address and will be able to on/off your validator.
        - Public Key - Paste public key you created in step 2.
        - Commission - Set commission for delegated stakes.
        - Coin - Enter coin of your stake (MNT).
        - Stake - Enter value of your stake in given coin.
